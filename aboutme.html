	 <h3> Dance </h3>
	 <p> Dancing is one of my faovrite hobbies. I have been dancing for the past 10 years, 9 years in a competitve studio. <br> 
		 I compete and perform. Being in dance for so many years have introduced me to new people who share a passion. <br>
		I am a part of two dance teams, one at a separate studio and one at school. With my separate studio I travel and compete around the country. <br>
		 Dance helps me escape my mind and into movement and music; this is one of my top ways to help reduce my stress. <br> 
		 It's my save space, a non-judgmental area where I can let myself go and get lost in the music. It sounds pretty basic but it is true.
	 </p>
	 <p>

		 <ul>
			 <li> Ballet </li>
			 <li> Jazz </li>
			 <li> Contemporary </li>
			 <li> Lyrical </li>
			 <li> Hiphop </li>
			 <li> Competitive </li>
			 <li> Other technique classes </li>

	 <h3> Sewing </h3>
		<p> I love to sew. Sewing is a great way for me to think and problem solve. At the end, I always end up with a cute project. <br>
			My final goal in sewing is to have enough experience that I can sew my own clothing so I don't have to spend money buying clothes. <br>
			This way my clothing can be perfectly customized to my likings and fittings. <br> 
			I want to go into a sewing or fashion career in the future, preferably a fashion college in New York such as Parsons or FIT. <br>
	 </p>

			 Completed Projects Oldest-Newest:
			 <ul> 
				 <li> Drawstring Bag </li>
				 <li> Apron </li>

		 <h3> College &amp; Travel </h3>
		 <p> When I graduate high school I want to go straight into college. I want to go to a fashion college, perferablly in New York. <br>
			 New York City is my favorite place in the entire world. I feel as if that's where I belong my entire life, and I can't way to go there. <br>
			 I've been to New York several times before. New York streets are very simple and easy to read, it is a grid system. <br>
			 The liveliness and reality in New York just feels like home. <br>
			 I have created a dream circle with some friends with us all living in NYC together in an apartment looking over the sparkling lights, the city that never sleeps. <br> 
			 It's my dream city; however, if I am to ever get the chance to travel outside the country I'd love to go to Belgium. <br> 
			 I have done research and assignments on the city of Bruges in Belgium and it looks like a fairytale there. The renissance feeling looks very dreamy.
