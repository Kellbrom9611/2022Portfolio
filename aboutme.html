	 <h4> Dance </h4>
	 <p> Dancing is one of my faovrite hobbies. I have been dancing for the past 10 years, 9 years in a competitve studio. <br> 
		 I compete and perform. Being in dance for so many years have indoruced me to new people who share a passion. <br>
		 Dance helps me escape my mind and into movement and music; this is one of my top ways to help reduce my stress.

		 <ul>
			 <li> Ballet </li>

	 <h4> Sewing <h4>
		<p> I love to sew. Sewing is a great way for me to think and problem solve. At the end, I always end up with a cute project. <br>
			My final goal in sewing is to have enough experience that I can sew my own clothing so I don't have to spend money buying clothes. <br>
			This way my clothing can be perfectly customized to my likings and fittings. <br> 
			I want to go into a sewing or fashion career in the future, preferably a fashion college in New York such as Parsons or FIT. <br>
